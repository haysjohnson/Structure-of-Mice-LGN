# Structure-of-Mice-LGN

A year-long honours cognitive science project supervised by Dr. Erik Cook at McGill University, coded entirely in MATLAB and based on data recorded by Dr. Cook. Final lab report as well as all MATALB code used has been uploaded. Code written by both Hays Johnson and Erik Cook. Datasets are too large to upload, and original MATLAB figures and JPG/PNG versions have yet to be uploaded, although final versions can be seen in PDF report.
